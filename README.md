**THE GAME IS STILL NOT COMPLETE YET** ![pink](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)

## Description

**Description:** The game is like a new version of the Droll game that was released in the nineties. We tried to build it in pirate mode and enhance the graphics.

The game can be played in solo mode for now ![red](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+). Just hit play and you are good to go üòä. The number of levels is limited to three for now though (gonna add more in the near future INSHA'ALLAH).

The incomplete part is the network. Where you can play in a team with your friends. So don't try it until I allow you to, if you don't want your PC to burn ‚ò†Ô∏è.
